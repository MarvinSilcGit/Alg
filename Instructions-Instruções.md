# Algorithms to be solved
The goal is SOLVING many algotithms in some languages and show for anyone who wants by aiding me with CV and learning with logic programming and tests.

The source of the algorithms (the challenge don't the source code) of 2018-2019 folder came from book: COUTINHO, Nilo Ney. Introdução à programação com Python. NovaTec, 2014.
